The DriverPass project focused on designing a comprehensive system to provide online and on-the-road driver training. The client, DriverPass, wanted a platform that would help reduce the high failure rate of driving tests by making driver education more accessible and structured. The system needed to allow customers to schedule driving lessons, track their progress, and access online courses, while also enabling DriverPass staff to manage appointments, drivers, and vehicles. Additionally, the project emphasized secure access and data handling, with functionalities such as user roles, reporting, and the ability to communicate updates from the DMV. A strong focus was placed on performance, platform compatibility, and adaptability to ensure that the system would meet the needs of a diverse user base.

One of the project’s strengths was the thorough documentation of requirements, both functional and nonfunctional, which provided a clear roadmap for the system's development. If I were to revise any part of this work, I would focus on expanding the adaptability and scalability requirements. Given that DriverPass could grow or update its offerings, enhancing the system's flexibility would allow for easier adjustments, such as adding new training packages or accommodating an increased user load. Interpreting the user’s needs and translating them into technical specifications was critical for this design, as it ensured the system addressed real-world problems and met the expectations of different users. Moving forward, I would continue to prioritize user-centered design techniques, such as conducting interviews and gathering user feedback, to build solutions that align closely with client needs and provide a seamless user experience.
